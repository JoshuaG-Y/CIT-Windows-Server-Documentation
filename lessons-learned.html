                    <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Date(s) Encountered: [e.g., April 2025]</p>
                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> [Describe the challenge, e.g., "Difficulty finding compatible network drivers for the specific CIT hardware motherboard on Windows Server 2025." or "Unexpected disk partitioning errors during OS setup."]</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution/Workaround:</strong> [Describe how it was resolved, e.g., "Located drivers from the chipset manufacturer's site for a similar server OS version which worked." or "Had to manually clear old RAID configuration in BIOS before partitioning."]</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> [What was the key takeaway? e.g., "Always verify hardware compatibility and pre-download essential drivers before starting OS installation, especially for newer server OS versions." or "Thoroughly check BIOS/UEFI settings for pre-existing disk configurations."]</p>

                    <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> [e.g., "Delays in getting the Virtual IP and NAT/PAT rules configured by School IT due to communication gaps." or "Troubleshooting why drhscit.org was not resolving correctly externally."]</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution/Workaround:</strong> [e.g., "Established a single point of contact with School IT and scheduled regular check-ins." or "Used external DNS lookup tools to trace resolution and identified a misconfigured A record."]</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> [e.g., "Proactive and clear communication with external dependencies (like School IT) is crucial. Document requirements clearly and follow up." or "Understanding DNS propagation and having access to diagnostic tools is vital for external access issues."]</p>

Verified user permissions in SQL."]</p>
                    <p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> [e.g., "Thoroughly document application prerequisites and dependencies. Isolate application environments using AppPools." or "Systematically check connectivity paths: application config -> server firewall -> SQL Server network config -> SQL Server authentication/authorization."]</p>
